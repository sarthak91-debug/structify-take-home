# Chord Intersection Counter

## Algorithm Description

The algorithm is designed to count the number of intersections between chords in a circle. Each chord is defined by a starting and an ending point on the circumference of the circle, given in radians.

### Steps of the Algorithm:
1. **Initialize the intersection count.** Set it to zero at the start.
2. **Create chords.** Pair up the start and end radians for each chord based on identifiers.
3. **Sort chords.** Sort the chords by their start radians to process them in the order they appear around the circle.
4. **Check intersections.** Use a nested loop to check each pair of chords to determine if they intersect.
5. **Intersection logic.** Two chords intersect if one end of each chord is between the ends of the other chord. This is determined using exclusive OR (XOR) logic, considering the circular nature of the radians.

### Intersection Logic in Detail:
Given two chords A(start_i, end_i) and B(start_j, end_j), the intersection is counted if:
- The start of chord A is between the start and end of chord B, XOR the end of chord A is between the start and end of chord B.
- The start of chord B is between the start and end of chord A, XOR the end of chord B is between the start and end of chord A.
We also need to account for the wrapping around of radians at the 0 point.

## Time Complexity

The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of chords. This is due to the nested loop that compares each pair of chords to check for intersections.

## Drawbacks

- **Scalability:** Due to its O(n^2) time complexity, the algorithm does not scale well with large numbers of chords.
- **Efficiency:** The algorithm performs redundant comparisons that could be avoided with a more efficient data structure.

## Possible Enhancements

- **Sweep Line Algorithm:** Implement a sweep line algorithm with a balanced binary search tree to manage active chords. This could potentially reduce the time complexity to O(n log n).
- **Segment Tree or Interval Tree:** These data structures can help with efficiently finding intersections and might improve the performance for large datasets.
- **Parallel Processing:** For very large datasets, the problem could be divided into subproblems and processed in parallel.
